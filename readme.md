#Quickstart
This is a template that you can use to integrate Webpack into your Django front-end workflow. 

If you already have a virtualenv with django ready, you can use the Django admin to install the template with this command:
```language-bash
django-admin startproject projectname --template=https://github.com/toymakerlabs/django-webpack-scaffolding.zip --extension=js,json
```

For more information on Webpack and Webpack with Django, check out these links below:
* [What is Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/docs/what-is-webpack.html): An overview of Webpack
* [Webpack with Django](http://owaislone.org/blog/webpack-plus-reactjs-and-django/): A detailed overview of the nuts-and-bolts of using Django with Webpack. By Owais Lone.


If you don't have Django set up yet, follow along with the quick setup guide below, or head to my blog post for a more detailed overview.

###Setting up the Development Environment
Webpack requires NodeJS. We're not actually serving our project from Node, but we're using it to run a dev server, and to bundle and minify our static JS and CSS. Technically, we don't need node on our production server since we're building locally and following Django's normal *collectstatic* process.

But for your dev environment, verify that you have Node, npm, and virtualenv installed.

`node -v`
should yield > v4.2.2
`npm -v`
should yield > 2.14.7
`virtualenv --version`
should yeild > 13.1.0

[Virtualenv installation (OSX)](http://sourabhbajaj.com/mac-setup/Python/virtualenv.html)

###Create a New Virtualenv
For Django 1.9 we're going to use Python 3. 
```language-bash
virtualenv -p python3 projectname && cd projectname
```

Activate the virtualenv using the command:
`source bin/activate`

###Install Django
First install Django so that we can use *django-admin.*
```language-bash
pip install django==1.9.6
```

###Run Startproject
The [startproject](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/ref/django-admin/#startproject) command accepts a parameter called *template*. Replace **projectname** in the command with the name of your project.

```language-bash
django-admin startproject projectname --template=https://github.com/toymakerlabs/django-webpack-scaffolding/archive/master.zip --extension=js,json
```


###Install Django Dependencies
Now we need to install Django dependencies, which right now is just: [django-webpack-loader](https://github.com/owais/django-webpack-loader)
```language-bash
cd projectname
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

###Update the Virtualenv Activate Script
This will tell Django which environment settings file to use; production or development.

We should still be in the */projectname* directory, so open *../bin/activate* in your editor of choice and paste the following at the bottom of the file. (Again change *projectname* to the name of your project)

```language-bash
DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE="projectname.config.settings_development"
export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE
```

Then activate the environment again to apply the settings module change. From the projectname folder:

```language-bash
source ../bin/activate
```
**Tip:** Verify the value of DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE by echoing it in the terminal:`echo $DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE`. It should print: *projectname.config.settings_development*


###Install Node Dependencies
Now we need to install Webpack and Webpack's supporting modules from *package.json*.


```language-bash
npm install
```

###Create an Initial Bundle
Test our config. This should create `./webpack-stats.json`


```language-bash
npm run build
```


###Start Webpack

```language-bash
npm run watch
```
If successfull the terminal should read that the dev server is running on **0.0.0.0:3000** 

 

###Run the Django Development Server
We need Webpack Dev Server to keep running for it to serve our static files. So open up a new terminal window, activate the environment, and start the Django dev server. 
```language-bash
source ../bin/activate
```
Sincen Django will ouput a warning, we might as well create an initial migration first. 
```language-bash
python manage.py migrate
```
Run the dev server

```language-bash
python manage.py runserver
```

###Check it in the browser
Open your browser and paste:http://127.0.0.1:8000/

######Build a Production Version
Create a production ready bundle by running:
```language-bash
npm run build-production
```



###Workflow Overview

1. Start the node dev server by running `npm run watch`
2. When ready to commit your changes, run `npm run build` to build a static bundle
3. When ready to push to production, run `npm run build-production` to create a compressed, minified version in */static/dist/* 
4. Push to production and run `python manage.py collectstatic` to apply the changes to the static files
